## Data Visualization with Flourish
#### Grid of line charts
In this visualization, we analyse trends in general goverment debts as the % of total GDP from 1995-2021 from the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. Japan has shown consistent increase debt.

#### Slope Chart
The slope chart shows the trends in the Debt-to-GDP ratio from 2019 - 2021. The target audience is one that is interetsed in knowing how the Government Debt has changed in the recent years and analyse the trends. As seen from the graph, there are three trends. The debt increases from the year 2019 to 2020. After 2020, the debt decreases for the majority of the countries, increases for some and remains nearly constant for one country. I used this chart because it is easier to analyse and compare trends across different countries for recent years. It is also easy to identify the relative debt of different countries based on the position of the country on the graph. Countries higher up have a greater Debt-to-GDP ratio in the respective year. A user can hover over a line to get more information about the country
I used orange and green colors to denote the two major trends and used grey for the one outlier country so that it remains in the background. To reduce eye travel while determining the country for the slop line, the country names and Debt-to-GDP ratio have been mentioned on both ends of the timeline.

### Comparing Different Charts
All the charts use the data from : OECD (2022), General government debt (indicator). doi: 10.1787/a0528cc2-en (Accessed on 05 November 2022)  in the visualizations.
The Bar chart shows the goverment debts as the % of total GDP for year 2021 for an audience that is interetsed in knowing the information for the latest year. Countries of concern are highlighted, it is unclear why the audience might be interested in these countries. The numbers provided above the bar make is easier to read the exact values. It is easy to figure out the government debt for each country. However, it is not possible to analyse the changing trends over the years for different countries and compare them.

The Grid of line charts does shows trends in the data over a period of time for different countries for an audience that is interetsed in knowing the trends for different countries. While this is useful to analyse how a country's Debt-to-GDP ratio performs overtime, it is difficult to read the chart. For instance, it is not easy to figure out that Japan has the highest Debt-to-GDP ratio. Countries could have been categorized based on trends to make it easier to group countries.

The Slope chart is an attempt to combine the advanatges of both these charts. It focuses on recent trends and categorises countries based on trends for an audience that is interested in studying trends for the latest years and knowing how countries perform relative to each other.. It makes is easy for the user to determine which countries have the highest and lowest Debt-to-GDP ratio by the position on the graph as well as the numneric values. Users can hover over a line to get more information.If the numbers of countries is more, this chart could be difficult to read. To overcome this, we could focus on countries of interest and show the other countries in grey.
