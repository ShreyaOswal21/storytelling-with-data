- Color theories
- Graph techniques for different purposes
- Introduction to tableau
- Find and preprocess data for visualization
- Build projects to start my portfolio

# Final Project
Topic: Journey through sleep-Students have been sleep-deprived, small steps can help make a change
It discusses the importance of sleep and its correlation to memory. It brings to attention that students have been sleep deprived and focuses on students at Carnegie Mellon University. It aims to encourage students to adopt a healthy sleep schedule by changing their caffeine consumption and screen time habits. It uses statistics and graphs to convey the correlation between caffeine comsumtion, especially coffee,and sleep and use of screen and sleep.

The project was divided into three parts:

Part 1
Part 1 involved choosing the topic, creating the story outline, initial sketches, getting working datasets and choosing the medium for presenting the information

Part 2
Part 2 involved using the initial outline and sketches to create wireframes and storyboards. I also conducted user researcha and user testing to gain more insight into what the audience wants to see.

Part 3
Part 3 involved putting all the components together to create a story on shorthand. It involved converting the wireframes into a story and incorporating useer feedback.
