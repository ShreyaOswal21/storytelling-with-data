#### What happens to your memory when you sleep?

People usually spend the major portion of their lives sleeping. This activity is importatn for the functioning of the body and the brain.
My final project will study the activites,particularly relating to memory, inside the brain when we sleep. It discusses the various stages of sleep and how these relate 
it affects activities related to memory.

By collecting data from research articles and experiments conducted on sleeping activity, the project will highlight the correlation between sleep and learning activities.
It will discuss the effects of sleep on short term memory, long term memory, memory retention,colidation of information and grades. By giving an overview of the importance
of a sleep quality on the functioning of memory, audience will be able to better understand their memory retention patterns and relate to them.The aim is to encourage the 
audience to maintain a healthy sleep cycle to enhance learning abilities and their overall health.

### Project Structure
The project will folow the structure outlined below:
1. Why is sleep important? - Time spent sleeping by people in the United States

3. How much can you remember? - Storage capacity of the brain
4. Working while sleeping - Effects of sleep on short term memory, memory retention, consolidation of information and academic grades
5. What happens and when - Show how each of the effects take place during different stages of the sleep cycle. Draw correlations to prioritise different stages of sleep depending on memeory activity
6. Make the most of your sleep - Suggest learning habits that follow from the data and research to help the audience develop a healthy sleep cycle and improve their learning and memeory retention capabilities
