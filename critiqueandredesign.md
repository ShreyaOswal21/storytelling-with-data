# Critique and Redesign
This task involves choosing a visualization, critiquing and redesigning it to make it more meaningful and impactful. 

## Finding a Data Visualization
I choose the following image:

This image depicts the carbon dioxide and methane emissions of the Top 20 companies. At a first glance, this visualization may seem unimportant to the audience. However, the data tells a much powerful story that has not been captured. These Top 20 companies together have emitted 523 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane since 1854. They have contributed to 35% of all carbon dioxide and methane since 1965. The severity of this lies in the fact that seven and a half billion people muct pay the price for a degraded planet so that some companies can continue to do so for their benefit. This data is an important aspect to draw the attention of policy makers, politicians and the general public so that they can enforce laws to bring this under control.

## Critique the data visualization

The visualization is able to convey the idea of the top 20 companies contributing to emissions of Co2 and methane. The stacked bar graph is arranged in descending order which draws the attention towards the companies contributing the most following the natural direction of eye movement. Hence, the chart is useful.
