# Critique and Redesign
This task involves choosing a visualization, critiquing and redesigning it to make it more meaningful and impactful. 

## Finding a Data Visualization
I choose the following image:
![emissions](TopTwenty 1854-2018 Clmn CO2CH4.png)
Source: Richard Heede, Climate Accountability Institute. 
link:[source] (https://climateaccountability.org/pdf/CarbonMajorsPDF2020/Top%20Twenty%20graphics/Top%20Twenty%20graphics/TopTwenty%201854-2018%20Clmn%20CO2CH4.png)

This image depicts the carbon dioxide and methane emissions of the Top 20 companies. At a first glance, this visualization may seem unimportant to the audience. However, the data tells a much powerful story that has not been captured. These Top 20 companies together have emitted 523 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane since 1854. They have contributed to approximately 30% of all carbon dioxide and methane since 1854. The severity of this lies in the fact that seven and a half billion people muct pay the price for a degraded planet so that some companies can continue to do so for their benefit. This data is an important aspect to draw the attention of policy makers, politicians and the general public so that they can enforce laws to bring this under control.

## Critique the data visualization

The visualization is able to convey the idea of the top 20 companies contributing to emissions of Co2 and methane. The stacked bar graph is arranged in descending order which draws the attention towards the companies contributing the most following the natural direction of eye movement. Hence, the chart is useful. However, the visualization lacks in some other areas mention in the "Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile".
The chart lacks completeness since it is difficult to figure out and compare the individual Co2 and methane amounts. 
It suffers from low perceptibility due to several reasons. The title does not catch the user’s attention. The meaning of the y axis label “MtCO2e” is not obvious to the user. The abbreviations used are not intuitive for most people.  The colors are not appealing or contrasting to the audience which affects the aesthetics and engagement of the chart. Infact, the black and red colors are distracting.

I would change the graph to a horizontal stacked bar graph where the methane amounts will be first, followed by the carbon dioxide amounts for better readibility since the methane amounts are usually usmaller than carbon dioxide. I will mention total amount of carbon emissions(methane + carbon dioxide) to reduce the effort the reader has to put to determine the numbers. I would change the colors to contrasting colors, like blue and yellow/orange to increase the appeal and make the distinction more obvious. I would change the title to something like “ Top 20 companies contributed to 523,323 million tonnes of carbon dioxide & methane emissions since 1854“. I would also change the y axis label to “Million tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions” to make the metric clear to the observer.
