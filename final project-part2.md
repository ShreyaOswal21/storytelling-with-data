###  The target audience I hope to reach with my story
The target audience for this story is college students. The story focuses on how sleep is important for the functioning of memory, which is important for students as they are continuously learning and developing new skills. There is also a focus on students from Carnegie Mellon University since the story mentions some aspects of the lifestyle of students from this university 

### My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
For my user reserach interview, I chose students from Carnegie Mellon University. I tried to find students who have varied sleep schedules so I could get feedback from all perspectives. This would also help me gauge the effectiveness of my story on different people.
User 1:
Age - 22
Masters Student at Carnegie Mellon University
Usual sleep time - 12:30 am
Duration of sleep - 6-7 hrs

User 2:
Age - 25
Masters Student at Carnegie Mellon University
Usual sleep time - 2:30 am
Duration of sleep - 6-7 hrs

User 3:
Age - 26
Masters Student at Carnegie Mellon University
Usual sleep time - 4:00 am
Duration of sleep - 7-8 hrs

### Interview script
My objectives for the interview were as follows:
1. Find out their sleeping time and habits 
2. What worked
3. What did not work
4. What in this story convinces students to change their routine
5. Any missing elements in the story that would support my case
6. Areas of improvement
7. I wanted to know if statistics regarding the effect of sleep on grades make it better?

Questions asked to achieve these objectives 
What do you think the story trying to convey?
What part connected/resonated with you the most?
What worked well for you?
What could be improved?
Is there anything else that you would like to see regarding this topic that would help you?
What was unclear or confusing?
Is there anything that was confusing ?
After going through this, is there anything you are inclined to change in your sleep schedule? Why and why not?
If you were shown how sleep correlates to grades, would that make a difference?

Responses:

User 1
| Question      | Response |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What do you think the story trying to convey? | Importance of sleep and how we can improve  |
| What part connected/resonated with you the most?  | Statistics on CMU students and how they are sleep deprived. "There were weeks where I only slept for 4 hours due to heavy coursework"  |
| What worked well for you? | The realisation that CMU students are actually sleep deprived and statistics on how bad it is |
| What could be improved?  | The first graph on coffee with the circles can be changed  |
| Is there anything else that you would like to see regarding this topic that would help you? | Other healthy sleep habits, statistics on the impact of screen time on sleep  |
| What was unclear and confusing? | The data for the effect of coffee consumption just before bedtime and 3 hours before bedtime was not as expected. "3 hours before bedtime should have been better". The size of the circles for the time taken to fall sleep depending on coffee were all the same.|
| After going through this, is there anything you are inclined to change in your sleep schedule? Why and why not? | I would try to monitor my coffee time. Would need more data for screen time |
| If you were shown how sleep correlates to grades, would that make a difference?  | Yes  |



User 2
| Question  | Response |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What do you think the story trying to convey? | Importance of deep sleep, students are sleep deprived, how can we improve |
| What part connected/resonated with you the most?  | Statistics on CMU students and graphs on the effect of coffee. "I love drinking coffee and found this information very interesting"  |
| What worked well for you? | Critical time to sleep and how CMU students are late by 23 mins, sleep cycle stages in blue, effect of caffeine consumption at different times  |
| What could be improved?  | Titles in general, especially for coffee and screen time, 2 steps should be visible first and then explanations, blue color for graph is not in accordance with the theme |
| Is there anything else that you would like to see regarding this topic that would help you? | Reasons for disturbed sleep cycle for students |
| What was unclear and confusing? | There was no data for the effect of screen time |
| After going through this, is there anything you are inclined to change in your sleep schedule? Why and why not? | Content Cell  |
| If you were shown how sleep correlates to grades, would that make a difference?  | yes for sleep duration, "sleep time is driven by circumstances so that is hard to change for me" |



User 3
| Question  | Response |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What do you think the story trying to convey? | Reasons why sleep is getting affected for students and solutions to improve it  |
| What part connected/resonated with you the most?  | Reasons given for sleep efficiency getting affected. "These are the reasons for my bad sleep schedule and I could relate to why my sleep schedule is bad"|
| What worked well for you? | Initial statistics on how we spend 1/3rd of our life sleeping and that's why sleep is so important|
| What could be improved?  | Avoid having 2-3 graphs in a row since reduces attention span, state numbers while stating 2 things to improve  |
| Is there anything else that you would like to see regarding this topic that would help you? | Importance of sleep for the brain and for academics, what effect does sleep have on memory and if any illnesses are caused due to lack of proper sleep, statistics on effect of using phone on sleep and memory |
| What was unclear and confusing? | Coffee graphs were repititive, in the graph circle graph, The size of the circles for the time taken to fall sleep depending on coffee had no significance |
| After going through this, is there anything you are inclined to change in your sleep schedule? Why and why not? | I would need stronger reasons and details on how harmful it is for my brain for me to make this lifestyle change. "I am used to consuming alot of coffee and it is a big shift for me so I would need strong datapoints".  |
| If you were shown how sleep correlates to grades, would that make a difference?  | Yes  |

Learnings:
- Users were able to identify the main objective of the story. My approach of using the setup, conflict and resolution narrative helped me to convey the idea successfully.
- Users could relate to the Carnegie Mellon University student statistics since they have experienced it. This makes them more interetsed and engaged in the story.
- Since most students consume coffee, they could relate to it. However, this section could be improved by changing a few graphs and eliminating some graphs
- Most of them are aware of their poor sleep schedule but do not know the reasons and how they can improve. They look for strong reasons to make an effort to change their lifestyle
- Titles are very important since its the first thing users look at. The titles in this story can be worked on

Additional insights from class critique:
-  Meaning of placebo might not be clear to all
-  Change titles
-  Too much content on the coffee 

Improvements in Part 3:

- Include statistics on the effect of screen time on sleep
- Add reasons for bad sleep schedule
- Include correlation between sleep and academics and grades
- Change the graph for the Coffee Consumption Time takes time taken to fall asleep since the size of circles is confusing users. Use the shorthand feature to show how each time affects time taken to fall asleep, in ascending order
- Keep the graph for the Coffee Consumption Time takes time taken to fall asleep and remove 1-2 graphs from the coffee to focus the attention
- Add the meaning of placebo
- Reduce content on the slide for coffee
- Change color of the sleep cycles graph since it is not inline with the color theme
